## Sign in with Spotify

To use this program, youâ€™ll need a **Spotify Developer account**, since Spotify only allows apps created under an organization (not individuals).

### Getting Started

1. Go to [https://developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com)  
2. Log in with your Spotify account

</p>

4. Click on **"Create an App"**  
5. Fill in the required information  
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, add:  
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
     ```

7. Click on **"Sign In"** inside the program. A browser window will automatically open (if two appear, just close one). Spotify will then ask for permission to access your music and playlists.  

   Donâ€™t worry about privacy â€” the program runs **only on your computer**, doesnâ€™t use any external servers, and nobody else can access your data. Everything stays private between you and Spotify.  

8. Once you grant permission, wait a few secondsâ€¦ and youâ€™re in! ðŸŽ¶

## Sign in with YouTube Music

Just like Spotify, YouTube also places restrictions on accessing its APIs. Since YouTube Musicâ€™s official APIs are paid and not suitable for a free tool like this, the login process works a bit differently.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com).  
   ðŸ‘‰ Tip: itâ€™s recommended to use a private/incognito browser window.  
2. Sign in with your YouTube account.  
3. Open the developer tools with **Ctrl + Shift + I** (or right click â†’ *Inspect*).  
4. Go to the **Network** tab and filter by:
    ```
     browse
     ```

</p>

5. Click on any **POST** request that appears. If none show up, just navigate around YouTube Music (e.g., go to *My Library* or open a playlist) until one appears.

6. Copy **all** the information inside the **Request Headers** section and paste it into the program.
